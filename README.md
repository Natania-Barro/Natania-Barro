- 👋 Hi, I’m Tatiana
- 👀 I’m interested in testing, traveling, bachata/kizomba dancing
- 🌱 I have experience testing a web platform and a mobile application, compiling software requirements and developing test documentation, testing new functionality and monitoring bug fixes, and worked as the only tester in a small development team. I am currently taking a course on testing automation in java 
I have a diploma from Yandex Workshop in the field of Software testing Engineer, as part of a team of three people I was a prize-winner (1st place) in the Bagaton-July 2023 from Yandex (competitions for testers similar to the Hackathon), I actively participated in testing pet projects starting from the idea stage, since I have an education in UX/UI design web and mobile applications (but I decided not to develop further in design, since this is not my thing).
I want to become a part of a professional team of testers.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on with people who, like me, want not to stand still, but to grow and develop, to learn new things

- 😄 My motto is: only the walking one can master the road
- ⚡ Fun fact: I started my career in it at the age of 50, life is just beginning
