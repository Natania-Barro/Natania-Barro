- 👋 Hi, I’m Tatiana
- 👀 I’m interested in testing, traveling, bachata/kizomba dancing
- 🌱 At the moment, I am looking for a project in which I can immerse myself 100%, participate with the team in the testing process, learn new things from more experienced colleagues and become another professional in the team.
While studying at Yandex Practicum, I realized that testing is a difficult but interesting profession that allows the brain to be on the move all the time, explore new directions in testing and develop into a Fullstack specialist. I continue to develop in this direction, I am learning the Java language to study automation and I am ready for a large flow of new information.
Hard skills:
- manual testing of web applications using DevTools, Charles and mobile applications on real devices and through emulators;
- working with the API via Postman; SQL database:
- preparation of test and project documentation;
- I understand how the client-server architecture works
- The web/mobile testing and UX/UI design courses I have completed help me test design layouts and prototypes in Figma.
As part of the team (of 3 people), Yandex became the winner of the Bagaton - July 2023. The jury noted the most complete and accurate checks of the main section of the application that I carried out, bug reports were compiled qualitatively and informatively, noted that they did not see several significant errors themselves and approved my suggestions for improving the functionality.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on with people who, like me, want not to stand still, but to grow and develop, to learn new things

- 😄 My motto is: only the walking one can master the road
- ⚡ Fun fact: I started my career in it at the age of 50, life is just beginning
